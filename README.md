In this lab, I set up my development environment with Visual Studio Code, Git, and Node.js. I created a project folder, built a basic HTML page, and viewed it in a browser. After configuring Git, I initialized a repository, linked it to GitHub, and pushed my work. I practiced Git workflow by creating and updating files, working with branches, and merging via pull requests. Lastly, I collaborated by forking a partnerâ€™s repository, contributing, and submitting a pull request.
