# web-dev-lab

In this lab, I installed Visual Studio Code, Git, and Node.js to set up my development environment. I created a new project folder called web-dev-lab and built a basic HTML page with a heading and a paragraph to display a simple message. Afterward, I opened the HTML file in a browser to view my work.
I configured Git with my name and email, initialized a Git repository in the project folder, and linked it to a new GitHub repository. I successfully added, committed, and pushed the HTML file to GitHub, verifying that the file appeared in the repository.
As part of the Git workflow tasks, I created and updated a hello.txt file with my name and student ID. I also created a new branch called feature-branch, added a feature.txt file with a brief message about what I learned, and merged the branch into the main branch using a pull request. Finally, I completed a collaboration task by forking my group partnerâ€™s repository, making a small contribution, and submitting a pull request.
